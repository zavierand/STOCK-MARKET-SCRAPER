# STOCK MARKET ANALYZER
This project is a simple stock market analyzer that presents users with five (5) metrics when presenting the selected stock back to the user. The metrics that will be presented are the current high, lows, EPS (earnings per share), P/E (price/earnings ratio), adn ROE (return on equity) at the time of the market opening.

## Overview
Simply speaking, the basic overview of this project is that present users with the current, up-to-date metrics for the stock market.

The use of APIs throughout the project to gather real-time data is something I wanted to showcase with this project. I plan to use two APIs in this project, an API to retrieve the metrics that will be outputted to the user and an API to automate and update the program with the latest data available at the start of each day/when the stock market opens.

## Development and Implementation
This project will be developed in python to practice webscraping and data mining. In future development of the application, implemenation plans will be in C++ to provide faster compiling time.
